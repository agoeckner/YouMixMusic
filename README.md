Project Description
-------------------

We will make a web-based music player, which allows people to create playlists
of Youtube music videos.

This will use the Youtube API along with HTML5, Javascript, and a potential C#
backend.

Repository Guidelines
=====================

Feature Branches
----------------

Developers should create "feature" branches when working on the code. The standard naming convention for feature branches is "feature/feature_name_here". When a feature is complete, it will be merged into "develop" by use of a pull request.

The "develop" Branch
--------------------

No code should be directly committed to the "develop" branch. Code should only be merged into "develop" using pull requests from completed feature branches.

The "master" Branch
-------------------

No code should be directly committed to the "master" branch. Code should only be merged into "master" from the develop branch when a release point has been reached.
